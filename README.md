# 🎬 Sakila Movie Database – SQL Schema & Practice Playground

Welcome to the **Sakila Database Project** — a comprehensive SQL playground designed for practicing database design, querying, and analysis using a rich, real-world data structure from a fictional DVD rental store.

Whether you're learning SQL, building backend projects, or preparing for data-related interviews, this project provides a perfect starting point.

## 🧠 What is the Sakila Database?

The Sakila database is a MySQL-based demo schema originally developed by MySQL. It models a DVD rental system with rich relationships across entities like:

- 🧑‍💼 **Customers**
- 📀 **Films**
- 🎭 **Actors**
- 🏪 **Stores**
- 🧾 **Payments**
- 🎬 **Rentals**
- 🧍‍♂️ **Staff**

This schema contains foreign keys, many-to-many relationships, and realistic constraints — offering a great environment to master SQL.

## 🚀 What's Included in This Repo

- `create_sakila_db.sql` – Complete SQL script to create the Sakila schema and all its tables.
- 🗂️ Table structures with keys and constraints.
- 🔄 Data types designed to mimic real-world relational databases.
- 📄 Use cases for practice queries, joins, views, stored procedures, and more.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use It

1. **Install MySQL** (or use a local Docker container with MySQL).
2. Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, CLI).
3. Run the SQL script:
   ```sql
   SOURCE create_sakila_db.sql;

## 🧪 Ideas for Practice

- 📊 **Find the most popular film genres by rentals**
- 💳 **Analyze payment trends by city or staff member**
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Identify customers with the highest overdue rentals**
- 📆 **Track rental activity over time**
- 🧮 **Create views or stored procedures for regular reporting**
